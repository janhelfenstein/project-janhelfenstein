# Waste in Zurichs Forests - Report

## Abstract

Waste in Swiss Forest is a concern for wildlife and the environment, but also for the perceived beauty of nature. Litter such as plastic bottles, cans or food packaging is often left behind by people going through the forest, and is detrimental to the ecosystem. This project aims to portray the state of waste in Zurichs forests at Hoenggerberg and Kaeferberg in June 2025, and to find solutions for the problem. For this, people in Zurich were asked about how they perceive the state of waste in the forests of Hoenggerberg and Kaeferberg. It was investigated, where they saw which types of waste in the forest and what activities were likely causing this waste. A special focus was placed on the impact of sports in the forest. Finally, participants selected possible measures to remove waste from the forest.

It was found that most litter in the forest lands around picnic areas and benches, in the form of consumer goods such as plastic bottles, cans and cigarette butts. While participants generally have a positive view of the waste situation in the forest (4 out of 5), they believe that activities such as barbecue, picnic or camping cause the most waste for the forest. Sports activities were not perceived to have an extra impact on waste.\
For measures against waste, participants prefer actions that are tied to personal responsibility first, such as trash-removal by the ones who left it, and to install more bins in the forest for this purpose. Fines for those who litter should further enforce this direct responsibility. Clean-up of waste by authorities or volunteers received the second-most votes.

## Methods

### Data gathering

For this project, 11 people in the forest were approached on the evening of Sunday, 1st of June 2025. They were asked to fill out a Google survey about how they perceive waste in that forest in general, and specifically on that day.

The survey consists of 19 questions, separated into 5 sections

1.  Waste in the forest

2.  Forest activities

3.  Sports in the forest

4.  Measures against waste in the forest

5.  A section about user's demographic information

A link to the survey can be found here:

On Monday, 2nd of June 2025, the survey was then also sent to residents in student housing at ETH Hoenggerberg via social media. Further, flyers with a QR code were hung up in the student housing complex.

To ensure validity, participants who filled out the survey in this manner were reminded again to only fill out the survey if they were in the forest on that day. But it since they were not met in the forest, like the first batch of participants, it can't be verified if they were actually in the forest on that day.

### Data processing

The survey was then processed with the help of R-scripts on the R-Studio platform. The R-packages used for this were tidyverse, readr, ggplot2, gt, knitr, googlesheets4, dplyr and lubridate. Git version control was applied and the progress was stored on a GitHub repository.

The final report was written as a Quarto document and published via GitHub pages. The R-code and the generated visualizations are listed below.

## R-packages

```{r}
#| label: r-packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gt)
library(knitr)
```

## Data import

```{r}
#| label: data-import
survey1 <- read_rds(here::here("data/processed/survey1-data-processed.rds"))
survey2 <- read_rds(here::here("data/processed/survey1-data-processed.rds"))
survey_timestamp <- read_rds(here::here("data/processed/survey-timestamp.rds"))
```

## Data visualization

The following point plot @fig-rating displays when survey was taken and how the users rated the waste situation in the forest around Hoenggerberg. The rating range was from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best (highest cleanliness). It is likely that the given rating reflected the tidyness at in the forest at that time.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rating
#| fig-cap: "Survey timeline and perceived cleanliness of the forest"
survey_vis <- survey_timestamp |> 
  group_by(weekday) |> 
  mutate(amount = n())

ggplot(data = survey_vis, 
       mapping = aes(x = timestamp,
                     y = waste_rating
                    )
       ) + 
  geom_point(shape = 2, size = 3) + 
  labs(x = "survey timestamp", y = "perceived forest cleanliness")

```

The next bar plot @fig-recycling shows the relation between the participants' recycling frequency and their rating of ETH's recycling situation. Generally, people who recycle more often tend to give a higher rating.

```{r}
#| label: fig-recycling
#| fig-cap: "Rating of ETH's recycling situation by groups with different recycling frequencies"
ggplot(data = survey_vis, 
       mapping = aes(x = rating,
                     fill = recycling_frequency
                    )
       ) + 
  geom_bar(width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Rating of ETH's recycling situation",
       subtitle = "answers from 7 students",
       fill = "recycling frequency")

?labs
```

The following pie chart visualizes the recycling frequency:

```{r}
# summarize the data
# count the occurences of frequency category, calculate percentages
survey_pie_freq <- survey_vis |> 
  group_by(recycling_frequency) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            fraction = n()/nrow(survey_vis))

# create pie chart
# had help by perplexity.ai, link:
# https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-to-create-a-pie-chart-with-f0XcFVCEQYOZ7Mmn3crgeA
pie(survey_pie_freq$fraction, labels = survey_pie_freq$recycling_frequency, main = "How often do ETH students recycle their waste? n = 7")


```

The following two pie chart visualizes how many people have a walkable station nearby, and how many people walk to a recycling station to recycle their waste.

```{r}
survey_pie_walkable <- survey_vis |> 
  group_by(walkable_station) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            fraction = n()/nrow(survey_vis))

pie(survey_pie_walkable$fraction, labels = survey_pie_walkable$walkable_station, main = "Do ETH students have a recycling station in walkable distance? n = 7")
```

```{r}
# create dataframe only with people with station in walkable distancee
survey_walkable <- survey_vis |> 
  filter(walkable_station == "TRUE")

# create summary of this df for pie chart
survey_pie_walker <- survey_walkable |> 
  group_by(regular_walker) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            fraction = n()/nrow(survey_walkable)
            )

# create pie chart
pie(survey_pie_walker$fraction, labels = survey_pie_walker$regular_walker, main = "How many of these ETH students walk to the nearby station? n = 5")
```

It is satisfying to see that all 5 students who have a walkable station nearby will walk there to recycle their waste.

How many of these selected people are regular recyclers?

```{r}
survey_pie_freq2 <- survey_walkable |> 
  filter(regular_walker == "TRUE") |> 
  group_by(recycling_frequency) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            fraction = n()/nrow(survey_walkable)
            )
  
# create pie chart
pie(survey_pie_freq2$fraction, labels = survey_pie_freq2$recycling_frequency, main = "How often do these regular walkers recycle their goods? n = 5")
```

## Table of the data with gt()

The following table sumarizes the relation between recycling frequency and the rating that students give to ETH's recycling situation:

```{r}

survey_table_recycler <- survey |> 
  group_by(recycler_cat) |> 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean = mean(rating),
            sd = sd(rating),
            min = min(rating),
            max = max(rating)
           )

# create quick table with gt
survey_table_recycler |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(title = "Rating of recycling at ETH by students, grouped by recycling frequency",
             subtitle = "Data from 7 students in 2025") |> 
  cols_label(recycler_cat = "recycling_frequency",
             mean = "mean_rating")

```

## Table of the data with kable()

In @tbl-survey-recycler , the same numbers are displayed, showing the recycling frequency and how it corresponds to ETH's recycling rating. But this time, the table was generated with the kable() function.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-survey-recycler
#| tbl-cap: "Rating of recycling at ETH by students, grouped by recycling frequency. Data from 6 students."
survey_table_recycler |> 
  rename(`recycling_frequency` = recycler_cat,
         `mean_rating` = mean) |> 
  kable()
```

@tbl-survey-recycler shows that people who always recycle their waste are rating the recycling situation at ETH higher than others. People who recycle less often tend to rate the recycling situation lower, at two or three stars.

This is also visualized in @fig-recycling\
