# Waste in Swiss Forests - Report

## Abstract

Waste in Swiss Forest is a concern for wildlife and the environment, but also for the perceived beauty of nature. Litter such as plastic bottles, cans or food packaging is often left behind by people going through the forest, and is detrimental to the ecosystem. This project aims to portray the state of waste in Zurichs forests at Hoenggerberg and Kaeferberg in June 2025, and to find solutions for the problem. For this, people in Zurich were asked about how they perceive the state of waste in the forests of Hoenggerberg and Kaeferberg. It was investigated, where they saw which types of waste in the forest and what activities were likely causing this waste. A special focus was placed on the impact of sports in the forest. Finally, participants selected possible measures to remove waste from the forest.

It was found that most litter in the forest lands around picnic areas and benches, in the form of consumer goods such as plastic bottles, cans and cigarette butts. While participants generally have a positive view of the waste situation in the forest (4 out of 5), they believe that activities such as barbecue, picnic or camping cause the most waste for the forest. Sports activities were not perceived to have an extra impact on waste.\
For measures against waste, participants prefer actions that are tied to personal responsibility first, such as trash-removal by the ones who left it, and to install more bins in the forest for this purpose. Fines for those who litter should further enforce this direct responsibility. Clean-up of waste by authorities or volunteers received the second-most votes.

## Methods

### Data gathering

For this project, a total of 27 participants were asked about their assessment of waste in forests around ETH Hoenggerberg. 12 people were approached in the forest on the evening of Sunday, 1st of June 2025. They were asked to fill out a Google survey about how they perceive waste in that forest in general, and specifically on that day. The following screenshot displays the briefing that the participants received before starting the survey. The photo on the right shows me in the process of looking for participants in the forest.

The survey consists of 19 questions, separated into 5 sections:

1.  Waste in the forest\
    (6 questions, 2 optional)

2.  Forest activities\
    (4 questions)

3.  Sports in the forest\
    (4 questions)

4.  Measures against waste in the forest\
    (3 questions)

5.  A section about the user's demographic information\
    (2 questions: age, gender)

### German survey

A second survey was created in German, in order to reach more participants. However, the workflow to entertain two surveys simultaneously was later deemed as too complicated. Hence, only two participants (an elderly couple) answered the German survey on the first day, and all following participants were shown the English survey instead.

A link to the German survey can be found here:

<https://forms.gle/gXJUSYirHmnU8XbF7>

The answers of the 2 German-speaking participants were manually entered into the English version of the Google Form on Thursday, 6th of June, by the study author. Thus, all analysis could be done based on the results from the English survey.

On Monday, 2nd of June 2025, the English survey was then also sent to residents in student housing at ETH Hoenggerberg via social media. Further, flyers with a QR code were hung up in the student housing complex. More flyers were also hung up at different picnic-area spots in the Hoenggerberg and Kaeferberg forests.

![](images/clipboard-970658310.png)

To ensure validity, participants who filled out the survey in this manner were reminded again to only fill out the survey if they were in the forest on that day. But it since they were not met in the forest in person, like the first batch of participants, it can't be verified if they actually spent time in the forest on the day they filled out the survey.

### Data processing

The survey was then processed with the help of R-scripts on the R-Studio platform. The first R-script "01-data-download.R" extracts the raw data from the Google Sheet that comes along with the survey. The second R-script "02-data-cleaning" then processes this data into a tidy dataframe, one cell per value, one value per cell. Finally, a Quarto document "index.qmd" is used to write this report within R-Studio.

The R-packages used for this process were tidyverse, readr, ggplot2, gt, knitr, googlesheets4, dplyr and lubridate. During development, Git version control was applied and the progress was stored on a GitHub repository.

The final report was then published via GitHub pages. The R-code and the generated visualizations, with their interpretation, are listed below.

## R-packages

```{r}
#| label: r-packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gt)
library(knitr)
```

## Data import

The processed data is imported from the data/processed directory which was created with the second R-script.

```{r}
#| label: data-import
survey1 <- read_rds(here::here("data/processed/survey1-processed.rds"))
survey2 <- read_rds(here::here("data/processed/survey2-processed.rds"))
survey_small <- read_rds(here::here("data/processed/survey-small-processed.rds"))
```

## Data visualization

In this section, visualization tools learned in the RBTL course are utilized to create different tables and diagrams to highlight certain trends in the data.

### Demography and timeline

The following point plot @fig-timeline displays when survey was taken and how the users rated the waste situation in the forest around Hoenggerberg. The rating range was from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best (highest cleanliness). It is likely that the given rating reflected the tidyness at in the forest at that time. Most people rated the cleanliness of the Hoenggerberg and Kaeferberg forest between 3 and 4, so there is room for improvement. But the lowest rating of 1 was not given a single time. No trends are visible regarding the gender of the participants.

```{r}
#| label: fig-timeline
#| fig-cap: "Survey timeline and perceived cleanliness of the forest"

ggplot(data = survey_small, 
       mapping = aes(x = timestamp,
                     y = waste_rating,
                     color = gender,
                     shape = gender
                    )
       ) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  labs(x = "survey timestamp", y = "perceived forest cleanliness") +
  scale_shape(solid = FALSE) +
  ylim(1, NA)

# the tip to include scale_shape(solid = FALSE) came from stackoverflow,
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/51775750
```

The figure is a bit hard to read, because most people filled the survey at around the same time. To make it more clear, the following table @tbl-weekday-gender presents the summarized data in a more understandable form:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-weekday-gender
#| tbl-cap: "Number of participants per weekday"
survey_weekday <- survey_small |> 
  group_by(weekday, gender) |> 
  summarize(amount = n())

survey_weekday |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  gt()

write_csv(survey_weekday, here::here("data/final/tbl-weekday-gender.csv"))
```

The second figure @fig-weekday also displays the number of answers per day, while also showing a more visible distinction between male and female responses. 12 people were met in-person in the forest on Sunday evening, of which most were male. One additional person answered the survey online later. From Monday to Thursday, responses came only from people answering the questionnaire online. Most of these answers came in on Monday, when the link to the survey was posted in a WhatsApp group chat for students living in student housing on Campus Hoenggerberg, which is only 200 meters away from the Kaeferberg forest. Most of these participants were also male.

```{r}
#| label: fig-weekday
#| fig-cap: "number of answers per day"

# same dataframe as in the code block above
survey_weekday <- survey_small |> 
  group_by(weekday, gender) |> 
  summarize(amount = n())

# adding the white labelling in this plot was done with the help of ChatGPT, prompt:
# https://chatgpt.com/share/6841b0b5-c2e4-8011-b70d-c15aacb89456
ggplot(data = survey_weekday, 
       mapping = aes(x = weekday,
                     y = amount,
                     fill = gender)) + 
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  geom_text(aes(label = amount), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), 
            color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Number of answers per day",
       x = "weekday the survey was taken",
       y = "number of answers")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following histogram @fig_demography highlights the demography of the participants:

```{r}
#| label: fig-demography
#| fig-cap: "age of participants in years"
survey_demography <- survey_small


ggplot(data = survey_demography,
       mapping = aes(x = age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black") +
  labs(title = "age of participants in years", 
       x = "age in years", 
       y = "count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

In the first question of the survey, people were shown a picture of a plastic cup on forest ground. They were asked about their feeling when seeing trash in the forest, from 1 to 5 (1 = very upset, 5 = very happy.)

@fig-age-gender-feeling shows that all participants reported a bad feeling (level 1 or 2) after seeing waste in the forest. There are no obvious trends from gender. But it is remarkable that only

```{r}

#| label: fig-age-gender-feeling
#| fig-cap: "Relation between age, gender and feeling about seeing waste in the forest"

ggplot(data = survey_small, 
       mapping = aes(x = age,
                     y = waste_feeling,
                     color = gender,
                     shape = gender
                    )
       ) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(x = "age in years", y = "perceived forest cleanliness") +
  ylim(1, NA)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-age-gender-rating
#| fig-cap: "Relation between age, gender and perceived forest cleanliness"

ggplot(data = survey_small, 
       mapping = aes(x = age,
                     y = waste_rating,
                     color = gender,
                     shape = gender
                    )
       ) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(x = "age in years", y = "perceived forest cleanliness") +
  xlim(NA, 60)
  ylim(1, NA)
```

x = age

y = days per year

```{r}
#| label: fig-age-gender-removalfrequency
#| fig-cap: "Relation between age, gender and desired waste-removal frequency"
ggplot(data = survey_small, 
       mapping = aes(x = age,
                     y = measures_frequency,
                     color = gender,
                     shape = gender
                    )
       ) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(x = "age in years", y = "perceived forest cleanliness") +
  xlim(NA, 60) +
  ylim(1, NA)
```

The next bar plot @fig-recycling shows the relation between the participants' forest-visiting frequency and their rating of the forest's cleanliness. Generally, people who visit the forest more often tend to give a higher rating.

```{r}
#| label: fig-visits
#| fig-cap: "Rating of cleanliness in Zurich's forest by groups with different visiting frequencies"

ggplot(data = survey_small, 
       mapping = aes(x = waste_rating,
                     fill = activities_frequency
                    )
       ) + 
  geom_bar(width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Rating of Zurich's forest cleanliness",
       subtitle = "answers from 24 forest users")
```

want: a plot that shows perceived cleanliness average per day

or do this in a table

`{r} #| label: male-female-subsets survey_male <- survey_small |>    filter(gender == "male")  survey_female <- survey_small |>    filter(gender == "female")}`

The following pie chart visualizes the recycling frequency:

```{r}
# summarize the data
# count the occurences of frequency category, calculate percentages
survey_pie_freq <- survey_vis |> 
  group_by(recycling_frequency) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            fraction = n()/nrow(survey_vis))

# create pie chart
# had help by perplexity.ai, link:
# https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-to-create-a-pie-chart-with-f0XcFVCEQYOZ7Mmn3crgeA
pie(survey_pie_freq$fraction, labels = survey_pie_freq$recycling_frequency, main = "How often do ETH students recycle their waste? n = 7")


```

The following two pie chart visualizes how many people have a walkable station nearby, and how many people walk to a recycling station to recycle their waste.

```{r}
survey_pie_walkable <- survey_vis |> 
  group_by(walkable_station) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            fraction = n()/nrow(survey_vis))

pie(survey_pie_walkable$fraction, labels = survey_pie_walkable$walkable_station, main = "Do ETH students have a recycling station in walkable distance? n = 7")
```

```{r}
# create dataframe only with people with station in walkable distancee
survey_walkable <- survey_vis |> 
  filter(walkable_station == "TRUE")

# create summary of this df for pie chart
survey_pie_walker <- survey_walkable |> 
  group_by(regular_walker) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            fraction = n()/nrow(survey_walkable)
            )

# create pie chart
pie(survey_pie_walker$fraction, labels = survey_pie_walker$regular_walker, main = "How many of these ETH students walk to the nearby station? n = 5")
```

It is satisfying to see that all 5 students who have a walkable station nearby will walk there to recycle their waste.

How many of these selected people are regular recyclers?

```{r}
survey_pie_freq2 <- survey_walkable |> 
  filter(regular_walker == "TRUE") |> 
  group_by(recycling_frequency) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            fraction = n()/nrow(survey_walkable)
            )
  
# create pie chart
pie(survey_pie_freq2$fraction, labels = survey_pie_freq2$recycling_frequency, main = "How often do these regular walkers recycle their goods? n = 5")
```

## Table of the data with gt()

The following table sumarizes the relation between recycling frequency and the rating that students give to ETH's recycling situation:

```{r}

survey_table_recycler <- survey |> 
  group_by(recycler_cat) |> 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean = mean(rating),
            sd = sd(rating),
            min = min(rating),
            max = max(rating)
           )

# create quick table with gt
survey_table_recycler |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(title = "Rating of recycling at ETH by students, grouped by recycling frequency",
             subtitle = "Data from 7 students in 2025") |> 
  cols_label(recycler_cat = "recycling_frequency",
             mean = "mean_rating")

```

## Table of the data with kable()

In @tbl-survey-recycler , the same numbers are displayed, showing the recycling frequency and how it corresponds to ETH's recycling rating. But this time, the table was generated with the kable() function.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-survey-recycler
#| tbl-cap: "Rating of recycling at ETH by students, grouped by recycling frequency. Data from 6 students."
survey_table_recycler |> 
  rename(`recycling_frequency` = recycler_cat,
         `mean_rating` = mean) |> 
  kable()
```

@tbl-survey-recycler shows that people who always recycle their waste are rating the recycling situation at ETH higher than others. People who recycle less often tend to rate the recycling situation lower, at two or three stars.

This is also visualized in @fig-recycling\
